# Project One: Tower of Hanoi

## Basic game

* The original basic game consists of three rods where you can stack discs of different sizes. The clasical game begins with all the discs stacked at the left rod ordered by size.

![Game starts](./imgs/begin.png)

* Player selects a top disc stacked in a rod.
* Player moves the disc where it wants. But the disc is only moved if these rules are satisfied:
    + You can only move the disc at the top.
    + The disc can only be moved to a rod where the top disc is larger than the one you are moving or it is empty.

* The game continious until all the discs are stacked at the rigth rod.

## Basic logic

* Each disc is represented by an integer number proportional to its size and beggining at zero for the smallest.
* The core of the logic is an array containing 3 sub-arrays.
* Each sub-array contains numbers which represent the discs.
* At the beggining of the game, the initial array is generated by a function.

* A function draws the discs based on the content of the array.
* An event listener is added to the top discs.
* When the player clicks on one of them, a variable stores "from" which rod is going to begin the movement.
* The previous event listeners are removed and new ones are used in the containers of each rod.
* When the player select a container, another variable store "to" where the disc is going to be moved.
* The variables storing "from" and "to" are used to select the top discs. If the "from" disc is smaller than the "to" disc, the movement is considered valid and the array is modified using shift and unshift commands.

* A function checks if all the discs are in the rigth side, if not call the main fuction again and the game continues.
